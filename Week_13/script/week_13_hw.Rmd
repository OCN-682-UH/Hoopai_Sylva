#Let's say you have multiple data files where you want to perform the same action to each. You can use a for loop #to do this.

#In the data folder you will see a subfolder called cond_data. Here I have 3 files of salinity and temperature data #collected from Mo'orea from a spatial survey.

#Read in one of the files so that you can see what it looks like.
